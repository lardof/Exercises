## Machine Learning File

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level machine learning projects. Each project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on different aspects of linear regression and polynomial regression.

# Projects

Beginner Level Machine Learning Project.ipynb: This project serves as an introduction to machine learning concepts and covers the basics of linear regression. It includes step-by-step explanations and code examples.

Linear Regression lvl1.ipynb: This project builds upon the previous one and explores linear regression in more detail. It includes data visualization, model evaluation, and techniques for improving linear regression performance.

Lineer Regression lvl2 Veri DÃ¼zenleme ve Proje.ipynb: This project focuses on data preprocessing techniques for linear regression. It covers data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values. The project also includes a practical application of linear regression.

Polynomial Regression.ipynb: This project introduces polynomial regression, a technique used when the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is nonlinear. It covers polynomial feature transformation and model evaluation.

Proje v2.ipynb: This project is an advanced version of the beginner-level project. It includes additional features such as regularization techniques and cross-validation to improve the performance of the linear regression model.

Reklam Geliris Analizi Projesi (Machine Learning).ipynb: This project focuses on analyzing advertising revenue using machine learning techniques. It covers data exploration, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.
